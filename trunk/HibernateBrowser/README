This is a data browser for the popular Hibernate framework 
http://www.hibernate.org/ that is used to persist Java objects. 

It's NonPolymorphic because it displays objects under there 
exact class instead of displaying objects that extend that class.

This browser is needed because it makes it easy to browse 
hibernate objects even if their data is stored in normal form 
in the database.

I hope someone will take this code and do something awesome.
